Habiba:

-	I created and designed some of the pages (dog walking, dog daycare, contact page, customerProfile form, booking, findingUsers, deleting, cancellingAppointment, forAdmin)
-	I connected application, businesses and admin forms to the database (creating in crud)
-	I created a page where admin can find customers from their dog breed and businesses from the service that they provide (findingUsers page) (reading in crud)
-	I created a page where admin can delete businesses accounts (deleting page, deleting in crud). Both of deleting and findingUsers page are in a page called forAdmin.
-	I involved a bit in sessions as it was divided
-	I created a link between cleaning class and other pages where it was needed for sanitizing and cleaning
-	 Was able to store the forms into the database using MYSQL
-	I created some feedback pages to make it easy to the user
